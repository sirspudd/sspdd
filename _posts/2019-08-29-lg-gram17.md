The [i7-8565U looks great on paper](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/149091/intel-core-i7-8565u-processor-8m-cache-up-to-4-60-ghz.html) but on the LG 17 I have to live with:

```
[root@pluck z]# cpupower frequency-info
analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: acpi-cpufreq
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency: 10.0 us
  hardware limits: 400 MHz - 2.00 GHz
  available frequency steps:  2.00 GHz, 2.00 GHz, 1.90 GHz, 1.80 GHz, 1.70 GHz, 1.50 GHz, 1.40 GHz, 1.30 GHz, 1.20 GHz, 1.10 GHz, 1000 MHz, 800 MHz, 700 MHz, 600 MHz, 500 MHz, 400 MHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance schedutil
  current policy: frequency should be within 400 MHz and 2.00 GHz.
                  The governor "schedutil" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency: 700 MHz (asserted by call to hardware)
  boost state support:
    Supported: yes
    Active: yes
```

so the theoretical:

```
Processor Base Frequency
1.80 GHz

Max Turbo Frequency
4.60 GHz
```

amounts to:

A 2 Ghz ceiling, and boost speeds of ............ zero listing.

I am a little perplexed; please help me understand whether I am a muppet or whether LG are snake oil merchants; coz pointing my finger is easy.

# TL&DR

Great laptop, light as hell with a glorious 17inch screen; no frills, lots of good decisions and everything except the fingerprint reader works out the box. One noteworthy kernel parameter required to boot the system (with a pevious EFI image; fixed by post purchase efi update): pci=nommconf 

# Addendum

1. Inside of the EFI configuration page, you can hit CTRL+ALT+F7 and then configure this machine with higher granularity than I have seen on anything outside of custom desktop builds. You can disable the ME entirely from the EFI menus, define memory parameters on the onboard GPU etc etc)
2. You can flash your firmware via efishell;
    1. unpack the [bios update](http://gscs-b2c.lge.com/downloadFile?fileId=FM0fY77bZ8MAF0W8T0Y4EA) to your ef00 partition
    2. boot into [efishell](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Obtaining_UEFI_Shell)
    3. change to the relevant ef00 partition (fs0: on my machine)
    4. locate the update directory
    5. run s.nsh to update your EFI image (with the caveat that this actually wrote the windows bootloader to my primary partition, breaking my systemd bootloader install until I booted off a USB stick, and reinstalled said bootlaoder with bootctl.)
    5. You can also flash the ME image if you want to use this functionality with the f.nsh script. On the one occasion I tried, the flashing failed as that region was not writable. I did not sink any time in resolving it, instread opting to disable the ME)
    6. "It is normally not possible for the user to disable the ME. Some undocumented methods to do so were discovered, however.[39] These methods are not supported by Intel. The ME's security architecture is designed to prevent disabling, and thus its possibility is considered by Intel to be a security vulnerability. For example, a virus could abuse it to make the computer lose some of the functionality that the typical end-user expects, such as the ability to play media with DRM. On the other hand, a malicious actor could use the ME to remotely compromise a system.\n Strictly speaking, none of the known methods disables the ME completely, since it is required for booting the main CPU. All known methods merely make the ME go into abnormal states soon after boot, in which it seems not to have any working functionality. The ME is still physically connected to the current and its microprocessor is continuing to execute code." - [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine#Disabling_the_ME)
    7. After updating the EFI you will no longer need to bypass anything to use the laptop (no further need for pci=nommconf)

# Overview

[LG gram 17 homepage](https://www.lg.com/us/laptops/lg-17Z990-RAAS8U1-ultra-slim-laptop)

When looking for a new laptop, there are always a slew of considerations and potential pitfalls. Laptop standardization on Intel hardware (along with Intel standardization on Intel hardware) has removed many of the grossest concerns, but every now and then you get a vendor who still manages to screw the pooch and render an otherwise awesome piece of hardware useless.

## Pros

* The screen is 17 inches; the absolutely tiny trim on the screen allows for a reasonable size chassis on an otherwise unreasonable sized screen. The panel is not actually complete crud. It is relatively bright, colours are great and the aspect ratio is 16:10, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600.
* The weight is 1kg; I normally dont register this aspect of devices, but this is light enough that it is always on me and I dont register its existence.
* The keyboard and touchpad are both decent
* Just about every decision on made on the Gram is pragmatic and easy to substantiate. No spec feels designed to win a pageant; the resolution looks good on a screen this size without sucking through battery life. The lack of a discrete GPU has no impact on machine used primarily for life/coding, removes the Optimus clusterfuck and drastically improves battery life. The lack of touch screen means one less thing to disable given I dont use a single touch enabled application on desktop Linux. Another added bonus is that this display does not end up being hi-dpi and hence does not break Qt Creator, KDE and 90% of existing Linux software.
* ~~There is (Carnegie Melon) EFI level disk encryption support, so on resuming from hibernating to disk, I am prompted for my encryption password by the bios and am in my stateful Gnome instance a couple seconds later. This coupled with systemd suspend to hibernate makes this the nicest battery life/session persistence I have ever had outside of Mac OS X.~~ There is a strong distinction between an EFI level harddrive password and encryption. I was a muppet and assumed there was some degree of parity there, but information is sparse, auditing and assurances non-existent and what articles exist are not reassuring. Dont mind me; if you really care about your data on this device you will be encrypting it manually as best you can.
* $1350 from Costco: i7-8565U, 16GB ram, Intel HD620

## Cons

* Machine (Costco variant) came with 2 M.2 slots, one of which was populated by a 256G SAMSUNG MZNLN256 (non-NVME). I booted this Windows drive out of the fast slot, put in a nice commoditised $180 Samsung SSD 960 EVO 500GB in for discrete Arch usage. The anemic non-NVME drive makes sense at this price point, but is by far and away the largest con with this device. There are 11 screws which need to be removed for you to gain access to the NVME slots, after you have removed the feet/screw covers.
* I have had no joy getting the fingerprint sensor to a functional point. I don't even know where it is on the peripheral system.
* The Bios is versioned 0.1 and was released 01/29/2019

# Installing Arch

There is only really one critical kernel parameter: pci=nommconf

Some other good egg had already tracked this down by the time I grabbed my Gram, so I merely booted the installer with this line and I was golden. My list of boot parameters is a little longer and probably reveals me to be all manner of clown flavoured douchenozzle, but might be useful for someone, so here they go:

```
initrd=\intel-ucode.img initrd=\initramfs-linux-ck-skylake.img root=PARTLABEL=NVMEROOT resume=PARTLABEL=NVMESWAP rw scsi_mod.use_blk_mq=1 modeset mitigations=off pci=nommconf i915.enable_guc=3 i915.enable_fbc=1 i915.fastboot=1 nmi_watchdog=0 random.trust_cpu=on
```

With minimum effort I have the nicest Gnome Wayland experience I have encountered to date.
