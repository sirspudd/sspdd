# Summary

Over opinionated bollocks ahoy

# TL&DR

* Stick with an iPhone
* Android is incredibly locked down; any broad pretense of being developer friendly is founded in fiction, and your ability to get root access to your device varies between manufacturers and handsets.

# Background

I am a Linux freak (Arch, thanks for asking) and am still in denial of the death of both Linux based Nokia OSes that would have scratched my architectural itch way more than Android ever could. Google have made Android succeed, but it isn't because Android is wrought by genius and implemented by gods. No, Nokia engaged in a little self immolation and Android provided the only game in town for people who either ethically object to Apple's execution of the iPhne or people who could not afford Apple products. The complete lack of competition coupled with Google's backing and heft are what underly Android's success. The problems are so manifest that Google's answer to Android's architectural shortfalls/failings (in a pique of Engineers Gone Wild) is to address the issue from the _kernel_ upwards with [Fuschia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia).

I mean, if people didn't use Android, what would they use? [Tizen?](https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/15001/enlightened) Basically the same manufacturers that were spoon fed Symbian, and cocked it up, are the same ones defining the Android experience of the average Android consumer.

I paid money for the first iPhone (my first US pay cheque), had an iPhone 4 for work, and outside of that have lived an Android existence. My handsets have been

* Galaxy S II (Death by sweat, jog Hong Kong)
* Galaxy Nexus
* Nexus 4
* Nexus 5
* Nexus 6
* Nexus 6P
* One Plus One
* Sony Xperia Z Google Phone Edition
* ASUS zenphone (death by sweat, jog Bangkok)

Most of these phones had software controlled by Google (With the notable exception of the Xperia Z Google Phone Edition which was disconnected from updates after something like a year), so my exposure to both carrier and manufacturer tainted roms was limited. After this litany of handsets, I was ready to revisit Apple land, and grabbed the iPhone X which led to a torrid 2 year relationship where I could simply use my phone as a functional tool rather than investing time and thought into addressing a death-by-paper cut barrage of inconvenient snags.
