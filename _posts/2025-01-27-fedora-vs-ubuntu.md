# TL&DR

Fedora have a clue, are working on a slew of interesting problems and write the software everyone else ships and relishes.

# Introduction

I work with Linux professionally. Ubuntu has really managed to take on an air of professionality which I find both perplexing and thoroughly undeserved. If you indicate you want to run something like Arch, there is an air of 1337 script kiddiness. You are perceived as being some risk happy nutter who clearly likes basking in the light of incadescnent operating systems.

This is rather at odds with the daily reality of Arch, where updates rarely bork your system and you rarely end up in the kind of dependency hell any Ubuntu user will happily indicate updating can land you in, especially if you reach for PPAs ofter.

I would actually go so far as to say that the whole mindset feels very much like "Nobody ever got fired for chosing Windows".

Arch feels a lot like Fedora with portage to me (where AUR is playing the role of portage). I have putzed with Yocto on a dialy basis for the last 8 years. That also feels like Fedora. The upstream source is largely consumed as intended, and the extent of patching involved is minimal, which in my mind is kind of ideal.
