My name is Don; I hark from a small sleepy South African town named [Durban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban). It is a glorious place with many virtues (topography, bird life, plant life) but safety is not amongst them. At 18 I left ZA for Lillehammer, Norway, as a Rotary Exchange Student, which happened to lay the groundwork for me joining Trolltech in Feb 2006 having just completed an honours degree in Physics/Computer Science in Grahamstown, South Africa. A brief stint in New York, followed by a decade in San Francisco deposits us at today.
