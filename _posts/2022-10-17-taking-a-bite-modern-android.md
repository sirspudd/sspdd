# Summary

I purchased a Google Pixel 7 after learning just how disparate my iPhone 12s speeds on Google Fi were from someone using T-Mobile. I was seeing 1.37 Mbps, she was seeing 36.55 Mbps. Purchased a Google Pixel 7 to use as a 5G AP and to see modern Android. It sucks donkey dong.

# List of grievances

* On activating my Pixel 7 against the Google Fi account it was purchased against, I was seeing slower download speeds than on my iPhone. I spoke to Fi support, they suggested installing pending software updates; a security update! It took an hour to install, and put this on my radar [https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-updates-too-slow/](https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-updates-too-slow/)
* I used to argue that Android was not shit, only the hardware manufacturers variants; looks like I might have to back off that assertion
