# it starts

We were interested in extending our place, so we approached Peter Zepponi (peter@zepponi-architects.com, Architect License. #: C-26699) of Zepponi Architects on Sept. 1, 2021. We had no complaints in our initial meetings, he seemed agreeable enough, at no point did our dynamic belie any issue. We entered into contract, he cashed his requested retainer check for $3000 and he requested/took possession of a copy of the keys to our house as we were due to travel, and he needed to take stock of the existing structure.

This was December 2021, he showed up at our house in our absence with our keys and with a random individual in tow and proceeded to dance/caress said person in our lounge infront of our internal security cameras. I normally wouldn't have given a sausage. I mean, it aint great, but it also feels like a bit of a violation of space/trust. This feeling of violation was to increase in scope though, when on return from said travel a couple weeks later, he proceeded to ghost both myself and my partner, ignoring emails, smses and phone calls.

# the long slow plod

It is now 2023; I have verified Peter is alive and well and I am not speaking ill of the dead, cool beans, he has now left me with no recourse but making this page and exploring the realities of escalating matters with the CAB and small claims court.
