# Procedure

* grab a costco prime ribeye slab
* clean the outside of the costco bag to avoid contamination
* open the costco bag and deposit the contents (including the juice) into your umai bag
* evacuate the bag using the water immersion approach or a vacuum sealer
* stick the cloth wick in the neck of the bag, but make sure that the bag is tightly sealed at the neck. The only stress I have had involved me using a single ziptie and hence the bag taking on more air (less skin contact). The bag does not have to be taut, but you will be second guessing your aging a lot less if you just make sure the neck is well sealed. (while wicked)

There really is nothing more to it; umai bags do make the whole process pretty idiot proof.
