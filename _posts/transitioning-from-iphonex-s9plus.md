# Summary

Over opinion

# TL&DR

* Stick with an iPhone
* An Android

# Background

I paid money for the first iPhone (my first US pay cheque). I then got an iPhone 4 for work, and outside of that have lived an Android existence. My handsets have been

* Galaxy S II (Death by sweat, jog Hong Kong)
* Galaxy Nexus
* Nexus 4
* Nexus 5
* Nexus 6
* Nexus 6P
* One Plus One
* Sony Xperia Z Google Phone Edition
* ASUS zenphone (death by sweat, jog Bangkok)

I am a Linux freak (Arch, thanks for asking) and am still in denial of the death of both Linux based Nokia OSes that would have scratched my architectural itch way more than Android ever could. Google have made Android succeed, but it isn't because Android is wrought by genius and implemented by gods. No, Nokia engaged in a little self immolation and Android provided the only game in town for people who either ethically object to Apple's execution of the iPhne or people who could not afford Apple products. The complete lack of competition coupled with Google's backing and heft are what underly Android's success. Google, knowing Android is a bit of a turkey which alientates native developers to the extent that Chrome is a second class citizen on Google's own phone platform. Knowing Android's architectural shortfalls/failings, Google decided (in a pique of Engineers Gone Wild) to address the issue from the _kernel_ upwards with [Fuschia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fuchsia) which I am sure will be awesome, if I live to see it ship

After this litany of handsets, I was ready to revisit Apple land.
