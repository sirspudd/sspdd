"This is what you would feed people if you were breeding them for meat" - Ellen

"i feel like they're probably what the elves gave the hobbits when they left for mordor; i eat one and I'm full for half a day" - Gerrit

"Your crunchies are inferior to the kiwi's mothers' Anzac bloody cookie. By the by, you arent an Anzac." - bozo squad

I wont bore you with the history or the sales pitch; if you are from the Southern Hemisphere, you know what a bloody [Anzac cookie is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_biscuit). Growing up in Durban, South Africa, these things were everywhere and were/are the defining baseline/bassline of any/every birthday party.

As an adult the virtues are pretty bloody clear

- Some people aren't gonna like em. Good, fuck em. The commercial cookie scene in the US is pretty bloody gory and the people behind Mr's Fields cookies are catering to a living (mouth) breathing audience.
- They are hard as a rock and hence travel well.
- They are salty as hell, so they are great for hikes/exertion.
- They replace and best any of the sports/energy bars I have ever tasted. (bias noted)
- They are actually pretty low on sugar; ~1.5 cups of sugar for 7 cups of dry ingredients and 330 grams of butter.

In any case; recipes abound, I have cribbed considerations off many and hence I cant cite every bloody influence. So follows my personal well worn recipe:

- 330g Kerrygold butter (don't skimp)
- 5 cups of raw rolled oats (no instant oats, the moisture defeats the purpose)
- 1 cup of flour (ideally not soulless)
- 1 cup of brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons of salt (clearly this should be to taste, and be cautious, but this is kinda the point of the cookie)
- 1/2 cup [Lyle's golden syrup](https://www.lylesgoldensyrup.com/) or [make your own as I do when Lyle's is prohibitively expensive](http://www.chefeddy.com/2009/11/invert-sugar/)
- 2 cups of trader joes shredded coconut or 1 cup if you are using a more high density coconut (the longer the coconut segments, the lower the coconut density)
- 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda

0. Preheat oven to 350F (180C).
1. Mix the dry ingredients in a baking container (except the sugar).
2. Melt the butter in a pan over low heat.
3. Add the sugar and syrup to the melted butter.
4. Increase the heat, dissolve the bicard of soda in a shot glass with a little warm water and add to the butter.
5. This mixture should froth on the addition of the dissolved bicarb, continue to stir while this frothing occurs until the temperature creeps towards a point where you would not longer want to touch it.
6. Dump this frothed butter/sugar/syrup mixture over the dry ingredients mixed earlier and mix well/uniformly with a spoon and/or your paws.
7. Throw your baking container into the oven.
8. After 30 minutes, remove the tray and use a spatula to divide the crunchies into rectangles roughly. This is primarily to increase the amount of surface area of the cookie to increase browning.
9. Re-add the crunchies to the oven and bake for a further 20-30 min depending on your preferences.

# Caveats

- 60 minutes gets you a very very dark cookie; possibly too much for some people.
- 30 minutes gets you a good looking cookie, but with the ratios above it is unlikely to be cooked in the middle which is highly unfortunate.
