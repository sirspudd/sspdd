Guten tag,
<br>
I am Donald Paul Braastad Carr.<br>
I like long walks on the beach and rendering vegetables.<br>

<br>
Thats not all there is to me though. <br>
I am a student at Rhodes University. Chances of you viewing the page without actually being from the university are slim and vanishing rapidly, so I will abandon any further info.
<br>
I also dabble in a little Reinforcement learning, and occasionally (rarely) show my mug at my local physics department.<br>
Its normally a long mug, because between the physics department and the comsci department is strapped, me. <br>

<h1>Graphics Project : Meteoric pleasure </h1>
<h2>Blurb</h2>
Earths psychologists have found the perfect solution to overpopulation. With an industrial strengh electric sander, and a hearty coat of paint, previously hostile environments can be brought to rein. Human beings can't tell the difference! (After all mice can't.)
<br> 
Our ride explores an asteroid in the process of beautification (terrafondling). Being pyschologists however, they missed the nearby meteroid belt, and constructed their rollercoaster right in the centre of it, much to our entertainment delight. 
<br>

The hearty sheen of the surface makes itself unavoidably apparant.

<h2>Satisfaction of requirements</h2>
lighting : I added two further bright white light sources to the environment. I made use of the opengl lighting
material model to lend my untouched asteroid surface a vaguely plastic artificial sheen. I also used it for all colour manipulations. My stars actually shine, emitting light of their own accord. (Although this light is not received by anything else in the model.)
<br>
texture mapping : My starry sky is created by plastering the inside of a sphere with a starry texture. I also texture map my earth like terrain and my meteoroids.
<br>
animated objects using hierarchical transformations : My meteoroids are animated using hierarchical transformations 

<br>
<h2>Further Aspects</h2>
I have created lists for all non-mesh objects rendered in my scene. (This is automatically handled for mesh objects by the mesh class supplied with the base code)
<br>
I dabbled with my spline for ages, in order to achieve pseudo gravity (slow up, accelerating down), a pathway through the canyon and an interesting ride fraught with flips and twists
