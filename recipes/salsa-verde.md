Trust level of recipe: 1/5 (historic preparation has used a lot of eyeballing)

* 2 lb tomatillo
* 1 whole yellow
* 2 medium avocados thrown into blender
* 2 medium avocados coarsely chopped
* 1 tbsp salt at a minimum and then to taste beyond that
* 1/2 head of garlic
* 4 tbsp lime juice (1 lime is 2T: https://spoonacular.com/academy/lemons-and-limes)
* 1 bunch cilantro (2 cups maybe? I was chastized for saying bushel)

1. Insert in blender
2. Whiz

This salsa mellows out and matures into a superior version of itself.
