# Recipe

Original recipe:

https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/spiced-rye-ginger-cookies-recipe

but severe liberties have been taken by me. I would sooner poke myself in the eye with a fork than use veg oil for baking.

* 1lb Kerrygold butter
* 567g dark rye flour
* 281g bread flour
* 4 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 tbsp table salt
* 3 tbsp ginger
* 1 tbsp black pepper
* 1 tbsp cinnamon
* 1 tbsp cardamom
* 1 cup (149g) brown sugar
* 4 large egg
* 1 cup blackstrap molasses
* 1 cup light molasses
* 2 cup unsweetened coconut
* 1 cup mixed peel (coz I could not find my candied ginger, which would really have been the ticket)

cooking instructions follow the original text; lest it vanish; combine all dry ingredients. mush butter with sugar, add eggs, make smooth, add molasses make smooth, add dry ingredients to wet ingredients. Et voila!

this results in a batter which was obscenely goopy, conjuring forth long dormant fears of quicksand swallowing me whole. I tossed in a couple more tablespoons of flour in the hope of getting the batter to the point of cohesion over adhesion, a point I have seen struck with different recipes. Alas it was not to be. The resulting batter still looked like a giant bear shit. I tossed it into the fridge for 24hrs to allow it to contemplate its navel and for the moisture to redistribute.

Then baked at 350F in a preheated oven. 20min gets you something soft, 25 min gets you something hard.
